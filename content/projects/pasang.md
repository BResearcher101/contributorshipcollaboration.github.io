description: Web browser extension for uploading contributors' information on journal management systems.
---

The _pasang_ browser extension helps researchers automatically upload information regarding the authors of a manuscript in bulk on a scientific journal’s submission website (JMS or journal management system). Currently, most JMSes only offer HTML forms to submit this information, making the process cumbersomely manual and error-prone, especially for papers with many authors. The _pasang_ browser extension allows researchers to expedite this process by automatically filling out the forms on the journal’s submission portals with the authors’ information that was collected and curated beforehand by using [tenzing.club](https://tenzing.club).

_pasang_ uses the _belayer_ schema to store and manipulate the contributors' information in the background. Thus, if you would like to take advantage of _pasang's_ capabilities make sure to export the contributors' metadata from your framework to the _belayer_ schema first.

The browser extension is still under development. The first working version will be compatible with the JMS of Nature Human Behaviour. If you would like to extend this capability to other journals, please see the Github repository of _pasang_ for further instructions or contact us.

_pasang_ is named after the first Nepalese woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest.
