Adding CRediT (the Contributor Roles Taxonomy) to the most popular open-source academic journal management system, Open Journal Systems will immediately allow hundreds of journals to recognize a wider range of types of contributions to research. We will also add uploading of CRediT to indicate who did what in a project, so researchers can use our free and open-source app _tenzing.club_ to prepare the CRediT information.

We hypothesize that the implementation of CRediT in OJS will result in more scientific research conducted by larger and more diverse teams. Thus, in a follow-up evalutation study we plan to evaluate this hypothesis by investigating the number of authors per journal article and number of countries represented across the associated journals compared to others.
