Zoom in and help out with translating CRediT into other languages at our second hackathon!
We will also work toward getting a machine- and human-readable website up with the translations.
The hackathon will be Monday 19 February, and here is the time in your timezone: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Translation+files+hackathon&iso=20240219T1930&p1=240&ah=2
Email or DM us (e.g. aoholcombe@gmail.com) for the Zoom link.


Many volunteers came together at our [first hackathon](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/blog/translation/), so we currently have draft translations into 8 languages, including Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, and Spanish.
Once we enter the translations in machine-readable form in [this repository](https://github.com/contributorshipcollaboration/credit-translation) 
 for journals to use, we will also have code in that repository to also render the translations in human-readable form.
