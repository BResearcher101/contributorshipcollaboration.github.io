To improve recognition of those who contribute to research, the _CRediT_ has been adopted by hundreds of scientific journals that publish in English. However, its use for rewarding researchers worldwide is limited by the need for translations into other languages. Translating CRediT would encourage adoption by non-English journals, and make it more accessible to researchers that are often overlooked. 

Thus, we are organizing a hackathon at the _Big Team Science Conference_ (register [here](https://bigteamscienceconference.github.io/registration/)) on the 24th of October from 11:00 to 12:15 UTC. During this hackathon, we will check and refine an existing German translation and follow steps to make it more official and also work on languages to be determined by those who attend.
