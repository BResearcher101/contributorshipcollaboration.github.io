To improve recognition of those who contribute to research, the CRediT taxonomy has been adopted by hundreds of scientific journals that publish in English. However, its use for rewarding researchers worldwide is limited by the need for translations into other languages. During this hackathon, Translating CRediT for increased accessibility and adoption, we will check and refine an existing German translation and follow steps to make it more official and also work on languages to be determined by those who attend. The hackathon is part of the online _Big Team Science conference_ (register [here](https://bigteamscienceconference.github.io/registration/)), all welcome!

__Organizers:__ Alex Holcombe, Timo LÃ¼ke, and Marton Kovacs
